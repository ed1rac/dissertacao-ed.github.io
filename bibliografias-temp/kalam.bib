	abstract = {None of the classical access control models such as {DAC}, {MAC}, {RBAC}, {TBAC} or {TMAC} is fully satisfactory to model security policies that are not restricted to static permissions but also include contextual rules related to permissions, prohibitions, obligations and recommendations. This is typically the case of security policies that apply to the health care domain. We suggest a new model that provides solutions to specify such contextual security policies. This model, called organization based access control, is presented using a formal language based on first-order logic.},
