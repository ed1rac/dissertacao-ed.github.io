	abstract = {Specifying a security policy that includes both permissions and prohibitions, may lead to conﬂicts. This corresponds to a situation where a subject is both permitted and prohibited to perform a given action on a given object. We adopt a comparative approach to investigate this problem. We ﬁrst investigate access control models based on rules, called Rule-{BAC}, and present weaknesses that arise when we try to manage conﬂicts in this model. In particular, Rule-{BAC} models fail to provide decidable solution to redundant rules and potential conﬂicts problems. Then, we show how a more structured model, say {OR}-{BAC} (Organization Based Access Control), gifted with inheritance mechanism make redundant rules and potential conﬂict problems tractable in polynomial time.},
