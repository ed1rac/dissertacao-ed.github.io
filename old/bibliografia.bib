A lot of access control models based on role and attribute ({RABAC}) have been proposed so far. These models use {RBAC} to establish static relationships between users, roles and permissions, and then dynamically apply attribute-based access control rules to user-role mappings, role-permission mappings and user-permission mappings, which to some extent makes access control model easy to use and flexible. However, these models still have some shortcomings in terms of access control granularity, flexibility and decision efficiency. This paper studies the defects of the current {RABAC} models and the causes, proposes more fine-grained, flexible and efficient {RABAC} model, extends the evaluation indicators of access control model and analyzes the access control granularity, flexibility and decision efficiency of {RABAC} model theoretically.},

	abstract = {Access control ({AC}) is a mechanism for achieving confidentiality and integrity in software systems. Access control policies ({ACPs}) express rules concerning who can access what information, and under what conditions. {ACP} specification is not an explicit part of the software development process and is often isolated from requirements analysis activities, leaving systems vulnerable to security breaches because policies are specified without ensuring compliance with system requirements. In this paper, we present the Requirements-based Access Control Analysis and Policy Specification ({ReCAPS}) method for deriving and specifying {ACPs}, and discuss three validation efforts. The method integrates policy specification into the software development process, ensures consistency across software artifacts, and provides prescriptive guidance for how to specify {ACPs}. It also improves the quality of requirements specifications and system designs by clarifying ambiguities and resolving conflicts across these artifacts during the analysis, making a significant step towards ensuring that policies are enforced in a manner consistent with a system’s requirements specifications. To date, the method has been applied within the context of four operational systems. Additionally, we have conducted an empirical study to evaluate its usefulness and effectiveness. A software tool, the Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool ({SPRAT}), was developed to support {ReCAPS} analysis activities.},

In particular, if algorithm A outperforms algorithm B on some cost functions, then loosely speaking there must exist exactly as many other functions where B outperforms A. Starting from this we analyze a number of the other a priori characteristics of the search problem, like its geometry and its information-theoretic aspects. This analysis allows us to derive mathematical benchmarks for assessing a particular search algorithm's performance. We also investigate minimax aspects of the search problem, the validity of using characteristics of a partial search over a cost function to predict future behavior of the search algorithm on that cost function, and time-varying cost functions. We conclude with some discussion of the justifiablility of biologically-inspired search methods.},

By simple definition, in classification/clustering analyze a set of data and generate a set of grouping rules which can be used to classify future data. Data mining is the process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure. It is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The actual data mining task is the automatic or semi-automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns. Data mining involves six common classes of tasks. Anomaly detection, Association rule learning, Clustering, Classification, Regression, Summarization. Classification is a major technique in data mining and widely used in various fields. Classification is a data mining (machine learning) technique used to predict group membership for data instances. In this paper, we present the basic classification techniques. Several major kinds of classification method including decision tree induction, Bayesian networks, k-nearest neighbor classifier, the goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of different classification techniques in data mining.},

In this paper, data mining techniques were utilized to build a classification model to predict the performance of employees. To build the classification model the CRISP-DM data mining methodology was adopted. Decision tree was the main data mining tool used to build the classification model, where several classification rules were generated. To validate the generated model, several experiments were conducted using real data collected from several companies. The model is intended to be used for predicting new applicants' performance.},

We compared the confusion matrix method to linear regression and error indices in the validation of a device measuring feeding behaviour of dairy cattle. In addition, we studied how to extract additional information on classification errors with confusion probabilities. The data consisted of 12 h behaviour measurements from five dairy cows; feeding and other behaviour were detected simultaneously with a device and from video recordings. The resulting 216 000 pairs of classifications were used to construct confusion matrices and calculate performance measures. In addition, hourly durations of each behaviour were calculated and the accuracy of measurements was evaluated with linear regression and error indices. All three validation methods agreed when the behaviour was detected very accurately or inaccurately. Otherwise, in the intermediate cases, the confusion matrix method and error indices produced relatively concordant results, but the linear regression method often disagreed with them. Our study supports the use of confusion matrix analysis in validation since it is robust to any data distribution and type of relationship, it makes a stringent evaluation of validity, and it offers extra information on the type and sources of errors.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks are nonlinear mapping systems whose structure is loosely based on principles observed in the nervous systems of humans and animals. The basic idea is that massive systems of simple units linked together in appropriate ways can generate many complex and interesting behaviors. This book focuses on the subset of feedforward artificial neural networks called multilayer perceptrons ({MLP}). These are the mostly widely used neural networks, with applications as diverse as finance (forecasting), manufacturing (process control), and science (speech and image recognition).This book presents an extensive and practical overview of almost every aspect of {MLP} methodology, progressing from an initial discussion of what {MLPs} are and how they might be used to an in-depth examination of technical factors affecting performance. The book can be used as a tool kit by readers interested in applying networks to specific problems, yet it also presents theory and references outlining the last ten years of {MLP} research.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning while providing the theoretical basis and conceptual tools needed for the discussion and justification of algorithms. It also describes several key aspects of the application of these algorithms. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. 
                    Foundations of Machine Learning is unique in its focus on the analysis and theory of algorithms. The first four chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows; subsequent chapters are mostly self-contained. Topics covered include the Probably Approximately Correct ({PAC}) learning framework; generalization bounds based on Rademacher complexity and {VC}-dimension; Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}); kernel methods; boosting; on-line learning; multi-class classification; ranking; regression; algorithmic stability; dimensionality reduction; learning automata and languages; and reinforcement learning. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Appendixes provide additional material including concise probability review.This second edition offers three new chapters, on model selection, maximum entropy models, and conditional entropy models. New material in the appendixes includes a major section on Fenchel duality, expanded coverage of concentration inequalities, and an entirely new entry on information theory. More than half of the exercises are new to this edition.},

Neural networks and its application in information retrieval systems
Abstract
Neural networks are a field of Computer Science related to Artificial Intelligence. The field aims at implementing mathematical models that are similar to biological neural structures. It is also capable of adapting its parameters as a result of interactions with the external environment, gradually improving their performance in the solution of a particular task. By using neural networks in computer information retrieval systems one can assign a dynamic character to those systems by allowing the representation of documents to be reevaluated and modified according to specifications of relevance attributed by users to retrieved documents. This work presents the main initiatives in applying neural networks concepts to information retrieval systems and evaluates its applicability to large document databases as is the case of the Web.

	abstract = {The ability to control access to sensitive data in accordance with policy is perhaps the most fundamental security requirement. Despite over four decades of security research, the limited ability for existing access control mechanisms to generically enforce policy persists. While researchers, practitioners and policy makers have specified a large variety of access control policies to address real-world security issues, only a relatively small subset of these policies can be enforced through off-the-shelf technology, and even a smaller subset can be enforced by any one mechanism. In this paper, we propose an access control framework, referred to as the Policy Machine ({PM}) that fundamentally changes the way policy is expressed and enforced. Employing {PM} helps in building high assurance enforcement mechanisms in three respects. First, only a relatively small piece of the overall access control mechanism needs to be included in the host system (e.g., an operating system or application). This significantly reduces the amount of code that needs to be trusted. Second, it is possible to enforce the precise policies of resource owners, without compromise on enforcement or resorting to less effective administrative procedures. Third, the {PM} is capable of generically imposing confinement constraints that can be used to prevent leakage of information to unauthorized principals within the context of a variety of policies to include the commonly implemented Discretionary Access Control and Role-Based Access Control models.},

The guarantee of the security requirements, described by access control policies ({ACPs}), cannot be obtained when there exist conflicts in {ACPs}.

We analyze three types of policy conflicts in this model, which are modality conflict, redundancy conflict and potential conflict, and then the respective resolution methods are proposed. Finally, we prove that these methods can effectively resolve conflicts in {ACPs}, and that after resolving the potential conflicts, the policies cannot derive any actual conflict.},

This challenge has been considered for several years within the distributed systems management research community and we have recently seen policy-based management emerge as one such promising exemplification. The focus of our work has been predominantly on supporting the requirements of large evolving enterprises. Such environments present a significant challenge for policy-based management as the fluidity and complexity of interactions occurring in such environments mean that prevailing static-based specification and analysis of policies and roles, would be inadequate in many instances. We are therefore interested in providing support for a dynamic policy-based management environment. This paper discusses the critical nature of providing both dynamic and static conflict detection and resolution and introduces a scalable computationally-efficient dynamic conflict detection mechanism.},

	abstract = {Distributed system management is concerned with the tasks needed to ensure that large distributed systems can function in accordance with the objectives of their users. These objectives are typically set out in the form of policies that are interpreted by the system managers. There are benefits to be gained by providing automated support for human managers, or actually automating routine management tasks. To do this, it is desirable to have a model of policies as objects that can be interpreted by the system itself. The model is summarized. It is clear that there is the potential for conflicts between policies. These conflicts may be resolved informally by human managers, but if an automated system is to recognize them and resolve them appropriately, first it is necessary to analyze the types of conflict that may occur. We analyze the types of overlap that may occur between policies, and show that this analysis corresponds to several familiar types of policy conflict. Some possible approaches to the prevention and resolution of conflicts are suggested, and this work is put into the context of other work on policies and related areas, including deontic logic.},

No Brasil, as operações de crédito de {IFs} devem ser classificadas em nove níveis de risco, conforme Resolução 2.68299 do Conselho Monetário Nacional. O provisionamento para crédito de liquidação duvidosa é constituído em função da classificação da operação, assim, quanto pior a classificação da operação, maior o valor a ser provisionado. De acordo com o Novo Acordo de Basileia, as classificações de risco de crédito são relevantes para determinar o capital exigido das {IFs} ara absorver perdas ines cradas em seus portfólios de crédito.
Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo desenvolver um modelo preditivo de classificação de operações, de forma a permitir às {IFs} se antecipar em tomar medidas preventivas quanto ao risco de crédito. Para tanto, foram analisadas dados das o eraçõcs de longo prazo de uma grande instituição financeira brasileira, no período de janeiro de 2010 a dezembro de 2012. Esses dados foram submetidos a uma Rede Neural Artificial! {RNA}).
Para determinar o poder discriminatório do modelo foi utilizada a Receurr Opcrating

	title = {Verificação de conflitos entre múltiplas normas em sistemas multiagentes},
	location = {Niterói},	
	abstract = {Em sistemas multiagentes abertos, normas são utilizadas para regular o comportamento 
dos agentes autônomos, heterogêneos e concebidos de forma independente. Normas descrevem 
o comportamento que pode ser executado, deve ser executado e não pode ser executado no 
sistema.  Um  dos  principais  desafios  no  desenvolvimento  de  sistemas  normativos  é  que  as 
normas podem entrar em conflito umas com as outras. Normas estão em conflito quando o 
cumprimento de uma norma viola a outra e vice-versa. Em trabalhos anteriores, os Conflict 
Checkers consideravam que conflitos podem ser detectados simplesmente analisando as normas 
em  pares.  Entretanto,  existem  conflitos  que  só  podem  ser  detectados  apenas  quando  várias 
normas  são  analisadas  em  conjunto. Este trabalho  apresenta  um  Conflict  Checker  capaz  de 
verificar  conflitos  entre  duas  ou  mais  normas  ao  mesmo  tempo.  A  estratégia  do  Conflict 
Checker é dividida em três passos: (1) aplicação de filtros para suavizar o custo computacional 
na  maioria  dos  casos,  pois,  o  problema  é  intrinsicamente  exponencial  (SHOHAM; 
TENNENHOLTZ, 1995), (2) transformação deôntica é utilizada para análise de várias normas 
ao mesmo tempo e (3) interseção entre as normas para verificação dos conflitos. Uma nova 
linguagem normativa mais expressiva, representada por uma gramática BNF, foi desenvolvida 
para definição de normas e um Conflict Checker foi implementado em formato de ferramenta. 
Dois princípios de validação foram aplicados: teste de software e verificação formal. O teste de 
software propôs inúmeros casos de teste para testar a capacidade de capturar conflitos e os 
benefícios da utilização dos filtros para suavizar a complexidade do problema. A verificação 
formal utilizou a técnica de DBC (Design-by-Contract - Design por Contrato) implementada 
pela JML (Java Modeling Language) na plataforma KeY para provar a corretude dos métodos. 
A estratégia desenvolvida nesta tese surge como uma nova sintaxe para definição e verificação 
de conflitos em sistemas multiagentes. },

	title = {Uma abordagem para detecção de conflitos indiretos entre políticas de controle de acesso},
	location = {Niterói},	
	abstract = {A constante evolução dos sistemas computacionais faz com que o uso de abordagens para a
gestão de requisitos de segurança seja uma necessidade contínua e crescente. Nestes sistemas,
um dos principais componentes de segurança é o controle de acesso. Políticas de controle de
acesso são um meio de definir acessos autorizados e não autorizados aos objetos. Estas políticas
autorizam, proíbem ou obrigam sujeitos a realizar ações sobre objetos. Nos sistemas em que
existem várias políticas descritas, conflitos entre tais políticas podem surgir. Duas políticas
estão em conflito, quando o cumprimento de uma política viola o cumprimento da outra política.
O conflito entre políticas pode ser detectado de maneira direta, observando a sobreposição de
atributos da política (isto é, sujeitos, ações e objetos) e de maneira indireta, através da análise
dos relacionamentos implícitos entre os atributos das duas políticas verificadas. Neste último
caso, os conflitos ocorrem entre as políticas que regulam o comportamento de diferentes, mas
relacionados sujeitos, especificando ações diferentes, mas relacionadas, que acessam diferentes,
mas relacionados, objetos. Este trabalho propõe uma abordagem para detectar esses tipos de
conflitos entre as diferentes políticas, concentrando-se principalmente no segundo tipo de
conflito, que denominamos de conflito indireto. Nesse sentido, as contribuições deste trabalho
incluem: a definição da política utilizada; um conjunto de relacionamentos que podem ocorrer
entre os atributos que compõe uma política (organização, sujeitos, papéis, objetos, visões, ação
e atividades); um conjunto de regras de propagação e de regras de conflitos. Três cenários com
políticas de sistemas reais são descritos na análise para detectar conflitos. A ferramenta
desenvolvida Conflict Detector recebe como entrada um conjunto de políticas de controle de
acesso, um conjunto de relacionamentos entre os atributos destas políticas e fornece como saída,
no caso da existência de conflitos, a identificação do conflito e as políticas que estão em
conflito.},

	abstract = {Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) is a flexible and expressive framework that allows policies to be expressed in terms of chains of relationship between entities as well as attributes of entities. ReBAC policy mining algorithms have a potential to significantly reduce the cost of migration from legacy access control systems to ReBAC, by partially automating the development of a ReBAC policy. Existing ReBAC policy mining algorithms support a policy language with a limited set of operators; this limits their applicability. This paper presents a ReBAC policy mining algorithm designed to be both (1) easily extensible (to support additional policy language features) and (2) scalable. The algorithm is based on Bui et al.'s evolutionary algorithm for ReBAC policy mining algorithm. First, we simplify their algorithm, in order to make it easier to extend and provide a methodology that extends it to handle new policy language features. However, extending the policy language increases the search space of candidate policies explored by the evolutionary algorithm, thus causes longer running time and/or worse results. To address the problem, we enhance the algorithm with a feature selection phase. The enhancement utilizes a neural network to identify useful features. We use the result of feature selection to reduce the evolutionary algorithm's search space. The new algorithm is easy to extend and, as shown by our experiments, is more efficient and produces better policies.},

	abstract = {Social Network Systems pioneer a paradigm of access control that is distinct from traditional approaches to access control. Gates coined the term Relationship-Based Access Control ({ReBAC}) to refer to this paradigm. {ReBAC} is characterized by the explicit tracking of interpersonal relationships between users, and the expression of access control policies in terms of these relationships. This work explores what it takes to widen the applicability of {ReBAC} to application domains other than social computing. To this end, we formulate an archetypical {ReBAC} model to capture the essence of the paradigm, that is, authorization decisions are based on the relationship between the resource owner and the resource accessor in a social network maintained by the protection system. A novelty of the model is that it captures the contextual nature of relationships. We devise a policy language, based on modal logic, for composing access control policies that support delegation of trust. We use a case study in the domain of Electronic Health Records to demonstrate the utility of our model and its policy language. This work provides initial evidence to the feasibility and utility of {ReBAC} as a general-purpose paradigm of access control.},

For instance, obligation actions may represent prerequisites to gain some privilege (pre obligations), to satisfy some ongoing or post requirement for resource usage (ongoing and post obligations), or to adhere to some privacy or availability policy. Obligations may also define states of affairs which should be maintained. An example of such obligations is the obligation “doctors should remain alert while in the operating room”. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for the management and enforcement of obligation policies. The framework is formalized using concepts from action specification languages and the Event Condition Action paradigm of active databases. Therefore, our framework allows reasoning about change in the state of obligations and, at the same time, provides declarative formal semantics for their enforcement. In this framework, we support many types of obligations and show how to manage obligation activation, fulfillment and violation.},

Free Flight is based on the concept that increasing international airspace capacity will grant more freedom to individual pilots during the enroute flight phase, thereby giving them the opportunity to alter flight paths in real time. Under the current system, pilots must request, then receive permission from air traffic controllers to alter flight paths. Understandably the new system allows pilots to gain the upper hand in air traffic. At the same time, however, this freedom increase pilot responsibility. Pilots face a new challenge in avoiding the traffic shares congested air space. In order to ensure safety, an accurate system, able to predict and prevent conflict among aircraft is essential. There are certain flight maneuvers that exist in order to prevent flight disturbances or collision and these are graded in the following categories: vertical, lateral and airspeed. This work focuses on airspeed maneuvers and tries to introduce a new idea for the control of Free Flight, in three dimensions, using neural networks trained with examples prepared through non-linear programming.},

Policy conflicting problems may arise when new access policies are generated that are possible to be conflicted to existing policies. As a result of the policy conflicts, private information cannot be well protected. The structure of access control policy including conditions and obligations is studied.

	abstract = {Modern distributed systems contain a large number of objects and must be capable of evolving, without shutting down the complete system, to cater for changing requirements. There is a need for distributed, automated management agents whose behavior also has to dynamically change to reflect the evolution of the system being managed. Policies are a means of specifying and influencing management behavior within a distributed system, without coding the behavior into the manager agents. Our approach is aimed at specifying implementable policies, although policies may be initially specified at the organizational level and then refined to implementable actions. We are concerned with two types of policies. Authorization policies specify what activities a manager is permitted or forbidden to do to a set of target objects and are similar to security access-control policies. Obligation policies specify what activities a manager must or must not do to a set of target objects and essentially define the duties of a manager. Conflicts can arise in the set of policies. Conflicts may also arise during the refinement process between the high level goals and the implementable policies. The system may have to cater for conflicts such as exceptions to normal authorization policies. The paper reviews policy conflicts, focusing on the problems of conflict detection and resolution. We discuss the various precedence relationships that can be established between policies in order to allow inconsistent policies to coexist within the system and present a conflict analysis tool which forms part of a role based management framework. Software development and medical environments are used as example scenarios.},

The adaptation of CPNN on the I-880 freeway in California was then investigated in both on-line and off-line environments. This paper also compares the performance of the CPNN model with a basic probabilistic neural network (BPNN) model. The results show that CPNN has three main advantages over BPNN: (1) CPNN has clustering ability and therefore could achieve similarly good incident-detection performance with a much smaller network size; (2) each Gaussian component in CPNN has its own smoothing parameter that can be obtained by the dynamic decay adjustment algorithm with a few epochs of training; and (3) the CPNN adaptation methods have the ability to prune obsolete Gaussian components and therefore the size of the network is always within control. CPNN has shown to have better application potentials than BPNN in this research.},

An important consideration in neural network-based incident detection systems is the deployment of a trained neural network on traffic systems with considerably different driving conditions. The models were developed and tested on an original freeway site in Singapore, and tested on a new freeway site in the US for their adaptability. The paper presents comparative evaluation in terms of their classification accuracy, adaptability, and network size. Results indicate that although the MLF model gives excellent classification results on the development site, the CPNN model outperforms the other two in terms of its adaptability and flexible structure.

The basis of the approach is the IDES (Intruder Detection Expert System) which has two components, an expert system looking for evidence of attacks on known vulnerabilities of the system and a statistical model of the behavior of a user on the computer system under surveillance. This model learns the habits a user has when he works with the computer, and raises warnings when the current behavior is not consistent with the previously learned patterns. The authors suggest the time series approach to add broader scope to the model.

A new experiment confirmed predictions of this theory regarding the ERN and a second scalp potential, the N2, that is proposed to reflect conflict monitoring on correct response trials. Further analysis of the simulation data indicated that errors can be detected reliably on the basis of post-error conflict. It is concluded that the ERN can be explained in terms of response conflict and that monitoring for conflict may provide a simple mechanism for detecting errors.},

A security policy framework specifies a set of (constructive) rules to build the system states and sets of positive and negative (declarative) constraints to specify wanted and unwanted substates. Models for AC (e.g. role-based, lattice-based or an access control list) have been specified in this framework elsewhere. Here we address the problem of inconsistent policies within this framework. Using formal properties of graph transformations, we can systematically detect inconsistencies between constraints, between rules and between a rule and a constraint and lay the foundation for their resolutions.},

Given a policy and a set of action constraints, the framework defines a range of monitors that filter the output of the policy to satisfy the constraints.},

Significant attention has been dedicated in the past to the use of logical tools for the analysis of security policies, but this work has produced a limited impact on enterprise information systems. Important reasons of the limited success of past research were the difficult integration of these approaches with the technological scenario and the limited scalability of many proposals. Nowadays Semantic Web tools are increasingly used in modern information systems. We show how the tools provided by Semantic Web and ontology management technologies offer an adequate basis for the realization of techniques able to support conflict analysis in security policies. Based on the use of these techniques, we propose a solution for two different variants of conflict analysis: (a) Policy Incompatibility, and (b) Separation of Duty Satisfiability. Experiments that test the techniques on large security policies demonstrate the scalability of the approach.},

We propose an approach for policy conflict analysis in which candidate policies (either newly created or modified) are analyzed on a pair-wise basis with already deployed policies, with potential conflicts between the policies being notified to the policy author. Central to the approach is a two-phase algorithm which, querying an information model, firstly determines the relationships between the pair of policies and, secondly, applies an application-specific conflict pattern to determine if the policies should be flagged as potentially conflicting. The algorithm is generic in the sense that all application specific information is encoded in the information model; as long as a minimal set of assumptions regarding the policy model are adhered to it can be applied in arbitrary application domains. In the paper we present the two phase algorithm and describe an implementation in which it is used to detect potential conflicts for both access control and filtering (firewall) policies.},

	abstract = {Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) is a machine learning technique derived from two solid backgrounds: Statistical Learning Theory and Mathematical Optimisation. {SVM} has recently been applied with success to a variety of problems, ranging from character recognition to appearance based object recognition. Some of the reasons for this success are related to the fact this technique exhibits good generalisation performance on many real-life data sets, is well-founded theoreticaly, the training process eliminates the possibility of local minima, there are few free paramets to adjust and the architecture does not have to be found by experimentation. However, since this is a relatively new approach, text books and papers are usually in a language that is not easily acessible to Computer Scientists. Therefore one of the objectives of this dissertation is to provide an introduction to {SVM} that presents the essential concepts and theory behind the technique and that is more didatic. Appearance-based object recognition strategies appear to be well-suited for the solution of recognition problems in which geometric models of the viewed objects can be difficult to obtain, although they are not naturally tolerant to occlusions. Some machine learning techniques have been applied in this problem like, Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), Probably Approximately Correct ({PAC}) and Neural Networks, but none posed as promising as {SVM}. Within this context, this dissertation aims to investigate the application of {SVM} to appearance-based object recognition. It presents practical results of classification initially using a small dataset and then exploring the full power of the technique on a relatively large dataset. It also presents experimental results using different variations of the technique and compares the recognition performance of {SVM} with the performance of Multilayer Percep tron Backpropagation Neural Networks.},

Ainda é difícil fazer previsões precisas de como o fenômeno vai afetar nossas vidas e nosso mundo, mas sabendo que Big Data vai afetar sua vida pessoal, sua casa, seu carro, seu emprego, sua saúde, suas amizades, sua alimentação, seu sono e até seu lazer. Dados produzidos em grande escala, com velocidade e variedade nunca antes imaginados e que a tecnologia atual tem dificuldade para armazenar e processar. Você ouve falar de Big Data todos os dias! Mas do que adianta uma montanha de dados se não formos capazes de extrair valor? Big Data vai mudar a forma como uma indústria produz, como um avião voa, como se planta um alimento, como se trata uma doença, como anunciar um produto e até como ir a Marte. Por trás deste fenômeno está o dado eletrônico, que se por um lado a poucas décadas era produzido por alguns poucos equipamentos e tinha um alto custo de armazenamento, hoje é produzido em tudo que é lugar e o custo de armazená-lo é muito baixo, e a cada dia fica mais barato. Como o dado é produzido? Como é armazenado? De que forma é consumido? Como extrair informação e conhecimento? Como tratar aspectos de segurança e privacidade? Esta obra traz uma introdução ao mundo do dado, em um estudo que vem desde sua geração ao descarte, com ênfase especial na sua análise.Esta obra está dividida em duas grandes partes: A primeira parte é uma introdução ao mundo da Ciência de Dados e Big Data, abordando questões que envolvem os modelos pré-relacionais, relacionais e pós-relacionais, como {NoSQL}, processos de transformação de dados, armazenamento analítico, como o Data Warehouse, e {HDFS}, sem deixar de tratar de maneira clara a Mineração de Dados e outras técnicas analíticas.A segunda parte é prática, onde o leitor pode implementar os conceitos estudados, desenvolvendo diversas técnicas de análise de dados como Classificação, Agrupamentos, Lei de Benford, entre outras.},

	title = {Adopção de políticas de segurança de sistemas de informação na administração pública local em Portugal},
	rights = {{openAccess}},
	url = {https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/handle/10198/7422},
	abstract = {Nas últimas décadas, com a crescente dependência das organizações dos seus
Sistemas de Informação ({SI}), o valor da informação assumiu uma importância vital
para as organizações. A atenção das organizações, que era focada primordialmente
nos seus activos tangíveis (físicos e financeiros), passou também a focar-se no activo
informação.
A Segurança de Sistemas de Informação ({SSI}) é um tema crítico a ter em conta nas
organizações de todo o mundo. Face à importância das tecnologias de informação
para o negócio e à utilização massiva da Internet e dos serviços que lhe estão
associados, o número de ameaças que a informação está sujeita é cada vez mais
elevado e consequentemente a necessidade de proteger os sistemas de informação
torna-se mais premente.
Tanto ou mais importante que atingir os níveis de segurança de informação
adequados a cada organização, é conseguir mantê-los. Não basta ter software e
hardware que contribua para a segurança da informação, mas também uma política
de segurança e uma boa gestão da segurança, de forma a alicerçar devidamente os
esforços de protecção dos activos do Sistema de Informação.
No que diz respeito à Administração Pública Local, os munícipes esperam das
autarquias o desenvolvimento e modernização dos seus {SI}, com vista a que a
disponibilização de diversos serviços de forma interactiva e online se torne numa
realidade cada vez mais acessível a todos e que a segurança dos dados associados a
esses serviços tenha sido devidamente considerada.
No domínio da investigação observa-se um número razoável de estudos sobre a
temática das políticas de segurança, contudo, o número de estudos é reduzido no que
diz respeito a trabalhos empíricos acerca das questões de adopção de políticas de
segurança. No caso da Administração Pública Local em Portugal, esses estudos são
praticamente inexistentes.
Dada a ausência de estudos sobre esta temática nas Câmaras Municipais, foi
elaborado e realizado um inquérito às 308 edilidades municipais, tendo por
finalidade contribuir para a constituição de uma base de reflexão acerca das opções
de investigação a desenvolver em torno da temática da “Adopção de Políticas de
Segurança de Sistemas de Informação na Administração Pública Local em
Portugal”.
viii
O principal objectivo do inquérito foi a obtenção de resposta à seguinte questão: As
Câmaras Municipais Portuguesas têm implementadas políticas de {SSI}? Com base no
levantamento efectuado concluiu-se que das 308 Câmaras Municipais de Portugal,
12\% (38) indicaram dispor de políticas de {SSI} e 88\% (270) indicaram não ter ou
ainda se encontrarem em processo de formulação da política para posterior
implementação.
Esta constatação deu origem ao problema de investigação que se funda na reduzida
adopção de políticas de {SSI} por parte dos Municípios em Portugal. A diluição do
problema de investigação implicou satisfazer os seguintes objectivos: identificar as
componentes e características das políticas de segurança existentes; identificar
factores que afectam a adopção de políticas de {SSI} por parte das Câmaras
Municipais, classificar esses factores e propor um enquadramento para auxiliar na
compreensão da adopção de políticas de {SSI} nas Câmaras Municipais.
Para se alcançarem os objectivos mencionados, este trabalho passou, para além da
realização do levantamento já referido, por mais dois momentos fundamentais. O
segundo momento consistiu na realização de 44 entrevistas semi-estruturadas,
conduzidas presencialmente, gravadas, transcritas e posteriormente codificadas. O
objectivo da realização das entrevistas foi recolher um conjunto de dados que
possibilitasse dar resposta a questões intrínsecas ao problema de investigação.
O terceiro momento fundou-se na recolha de políticas de {SSI} junto das Câmaras
Municipais. O objectivo desta recolha foi, para além de verificar as características e
componentes presentes nestes documentos, aferir-se a homogeneidade entre eles e
com isso propor-se um modelo base de política de {SSI} a seguir pelos Municípios.
Depois de concluído o percurso de investigação descrito, constatou-se que não existe
uma única política ou modelo base partilhado pelos Municípios que já aprovaram ou
se preparam para aprovar uma política de {SSI}. Com efeito, a inexistência de um
modelo de referência que possa ser seguido pelas autarquias constitui um obstáculo à
adopção de políticas de {SSI} à escala administrativa local.
Assim, a adopção por via legislativa ou por recomendação da Associação Nacional
de Municípios Portugueses de um modelo coerente, uniforme e flexível de políticas
de {SSI} para as Câmaras Municipais, constituiria um contributo ou passo decisivo
para a institucionalização dessas políticas.
Neste trabalho de investigação evidenciam-se como principais contributos, para além
dos dois modelos base de política de {SSI}, o destaque no que diz respeito ao conteúdo
das políticas, processo e contexto na sua adopção.},

	shorttitle = {Segurança nos sistemas de informação hospitalares},
	abstract = {Actualmente, a informação é genericamente considerada um recurso crítico para qualquer organização, exigindo políticas de segurança adequadas para a sua protecção. Tipicamente, a abordagem usada para o desenvolvimento dessas políticas, parte da avaliação do risco, que é feita com base no valor do recurso e na probabilidade da concretização das ameaças. Estes dois valores podem ser extremamente difíceis de determinar, especialmente quando a informação não está relacionada com objectos de valor quantificável e/ou quando o historial da ocorrência de incidentes é limitado, como é o caso da informação nas unidades de saúde. Por outro lado, algumas das abordagens existentes para a avaliação do risco consomem um elevado número de meios humanos e financeiros, originando, por vezes, limitações à aplicação do processo de gestão da segurança na organização. 
Atendendo a essas limitações, o principal objectivo desta tese foi o de propor uma metodologia para a implementação de políticas de segurança em unidades de saúde. Procurou-se transformar o processo da gestão da segurança em algo que as organizações, nomeadamente unidades do tipo hospitalar, pudessem implementar e gerir de uma forma ágil e natural, sem a necessidade de recorrer a recursos extraordinários. Pretendeu-se, ainda, orientar a metodologia segundo os mais recentes desenvolvimentos ao nível do modelo de gestão dos processos desta natureza, tal como os preconizados pela recente norma {ISO}/{IEC} 27001. 
Embora a metodologia proposta tenha por base alguns métodos e normas já existentes para a área da gestão da segurança da informação, apresenta soluções inovadoras para alguns dos aspectos mais críticos e que normalmente, exigem mais recursos. Em particular, são apresentadas soluções para as fases de identificação e catalogação dos recursos (elementos informativos) a serem alvo do processo de segurança e para a determinação do índice de risco de cada recurso. Relativamente a esta última solução, é proposta a utilização da metodologia de Delphi para estimar os dois parâmetros relevantes (o valor do recurso e a probabilidade de concretização de uma ameaça) que são usados para calcular o índice do risco. 
Propõe-se ainda uma nova organização para o catálogo de medidas no âmbito da política de segurança, com vista a facilitar o processo da escolha das medidas adequadas e em concordância com a filosofia de gestão da segurança subjacente à metodologia proposta. Este catálogo recolhe, naturalmente, diversos contributos já estabelecidos para outras metodologias. 
Por fim, são apresentados os resultados da aplicação da metodologia numa organização hospitalar. Estes resultados demonstram a aplicabilidade da metodologia, ao mesmo tempo revelam a desejada agilidade no sentido de facilmente e naturalmente a integrar no processo de gestão da organização. 
Apesar da solução proposta ter sido desenvolvida tendo por base as unidades de saúde, a generalidade dos seus princípios garante que, com algum cuidado e esforço de adaptação, esta metodologia possa ser facilmente alargada a outros tipos de organizações.},

	abstract = {In this article we propose a standard for role-based access control ({RBAC}). Although {RBAC} models have received broad support as a generalized approach to access control, and are well recognized for their many advantages in performing large-scale authorization management, no single authoritative definition of {RBAC} exists today. This lack of a widely accepted model results in uncertainty and confusion about {RBAC}'s utility and meaning. The standard proposed here seeks to resolve this situation by unifying ideas from a base of frequently referenced {RBAC} models, commercial products, and research prototypes. It is intended to serve as a foundation for product development, evaluation, and procurement specification. Although {RBAC} continues to evolve as users, researchers, and vendors gain experience with its application, we feel the features and components proposed in this standard represent a fundamental and stable set of mechanisms that may be enhanced by developers in further meeting the needs of their customers. As such, this document does not attempt to standardize {RBAC} features beyond those that have achieved acceptance in the commercial marketplace and research community, but instead focuses on defining a fundamental and stable set of {RBAC} components. This standard is organized into the {RBAC} Reference Model and the {RBAC} System and Administrative Functional Specification. The reference model defines the scope of features that comprise the standard and provides a consistent vocabulary in support of the specification. The {RBAC} System and Administrative Functional Specification defines functional requirements for administrative operations and queries for the creation, maintenance, and review of {RBAC} sets and relations, as well as for specifying system level functionality in support of session attribute management and an access control decision process.},

	abstract = {Information is a critical corporate asset that has become increasingly vulnerable to attacks from viruses, hackers, criminals, and human error. Consequently, organizations are having to prioritize the security of their computer systems in order to ensure that their information assets retain their accuracy, confidentiality, and availability. While the importance of the information security policy {InSPy} in ensuring the security of information is acknowledged widely, to date there has been little empirical analysis of its impact or effectiveness in this role. To help fill this gap, an exploratory study was initiated that sought to investigate the relationship between the uptake and application of information security policies and the accompanying levels of security breaches. To this end, a questionnaire was designed, validated, and then targeted at {IT} managers within large organizations in the {UK}. The findings presented in this paper are somewhat surprising, as they show no statistically significant relationships between the adoption of information security policies and the incidence or severity of security breaches. The paper concludes by exploring the possible interpretations of this unexpected finding and its implications for the practice of information security management.},

Investigating the impact of changing social values and modem technology on the operation of organizations, the new ideas featured in this revised edition update a book that has become a worldwide classic.  Named by Public Administration Review as "Book of the Half Century," Administrative Behavior is considered one of the most influential books on social science thinking, and was referred to by the Nobel Committee as "epoch-making."  Written for managers and other professionals who wish to understand the decision-making processes at the heart of organization and management, it is also essential reading for students in business and management, economics, sociology, psychology computer science, government, and law.},

As the primary contribution of this research study, the proposed model illustrates a general yet comprehensive policy process in a distinctive form not found in existing professional standards or academic publications. This study's model goes beyond the models illustrated in the literature by depicting a larger organizational context that includes key external and internal influences that can materially impact organizational processes. The model that evolved from the data in this research reflects the recommended practices of our sample of certified professionals, thus providing a practical representation of an information security policy process for modern organizations. Before offering our concluding comments, we compare the results of the study with the literature in both theory and practice and also discuss limitations of the study.

In order to construct models capable of detecting those attacks, different supervised learning algorithms have been tested and validated using a dataset of real data recorded by a wheeled robot and a commercial Real Time Location System, based on Ultra Wideband beacons. Experimental results with a cross-validation analysis have shown that Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers get the highest test score and the lowest validation error.

Previous work in this area has focused on mining positive authorizations only. That includes the literature on mining rolebased access control policies (which are naturally about positive authorization) and even more recent work on mining attributebased access control ({ABAC}) policies. However, various theoretical access control models (including {ABAC}), specification standards (such as {XACML}), and implementations (such as operating systems and databases) support negative authorization as well as positive authorization.},

The two most common problems present in access control policies are: inconsistencies and incompleteness. In order to detect such problems, various access control policy validation mechanisms are proposed by the researchers. However, comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the existing access control policy validation techniques is missing in the literature. In this paper, we have provided a first detailed survey of this domain and presented the taxonomy of the access control policy validation mechanisms. Furthermore, we have provided a qualitative comparison and trend analysis of the existing schemes. From this survey, we found that only few validation mechanisms exist that can handle both inconsistency and incompleteness problem. Also, most of the policy validation techniques are inefficient in handling continuous values and Boolean expressions.},

Policy conflict is one of the outstanding issues related to policy management. Nevertheless current access control policy conflict detection algorithms are completely dependent on policy specification and the applications, which make these algorithms non-reusable and non-extensible. To resolve this problem, we separate the algorithm from concrete policy specification and apply a group of matrixes to define the relationship between all access control rules and all kinds of access control policy conflicts. Finally we develop an extensible intra-access control policy conflict detection algorithm that is independent of application domain to which the policies relate. The experimental result shows that the algorithm offers similar detection efficiency comparable to conventional detection algorithm.},

In this paper, we review and extend P-{RBAC}'s existing conflict detection algorithm so that it can check conflicts in multiple policies. Our review includes the performance comparison on two conflict detection algorithms, triple-policy conflict detection vs. double-policy conflict detection. We find out that as the number of policies increases and the number of same condition variables in the policies increases, the running time complexity gets bigger. Especially for tripe-policy conflict, the probability of triple policy conflict also affects the complexity.},

The organization or large industries can store their big data in cloud storage on pay for usage scheme. As the big data are outsourced in a distributed cloud environment, securing and protecting the big data is essential. The various access control models, which consist of a set of security policies, are used generally to protect the outsourced data. Anomalies in the security policies dilute the efficiency of the access security model. Developing an efficient access control model to protect the data is a challenging and ongoing process. The primary goal of this paper is to analyze and detect the important anomalies in Attribute-Based Access Control-{ABAC} Policies. This paper presents an approach that uses Priority-level to avoid the conflict in {ABAC} Policies. This approach groups the rules of {ABAC} policies based on Priority-level and similarity with the clustering technique, and detect the anomalies in each cluster rather than all rules, which made this approach efficient.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a technique known as {FP}-growth algorithm to mining association rules. {FP}(Frequent Pattern) growth algorithm propose compressed information needed to frequent item set in {FP}-tree and {FP}-tree are finds all frequent item. The idea of Attribute Based Access Control has existed for decades. It represents a point inside the area of logical access manage that incorporates access control records, role based totally get right of entry to manage, and the {ABAC} approach for giving get right of entry to based on the evaluation of attributes. It gives a excessive level of adaptability that provide safety and information sharing. algorithms have an ability to reduce the cost of migration to {ABAC}, by in part automating the improvement of an {ABAC} coverage from an access control list policy or role-based access control policy with accompanying characteristic records. Paper shows {ABAC} policy mining algorithm. this algorithm iterates over tuples and in user permission relation makes use of selected tuples uses as seeds for developing candidate guidelines, and endeavors to generalize every candidate rule for covering extra tuples within the consumer permission relation by changing conjuncts in characteristic expressions with constraints. The experimental end result suggests that the proposed gadget better in performance than the existing system.},

@inproceedings{martin_inferring_2006,
	title = {Inferring access-control policy properties via machine learning},
	doi = {10.1109/POLICY.2006.19},
	abstract = {To ease the burden of implementing and maintaining access-control aspects in a system, a growing trend among developers is to write access-control policies in a specification language such as {XACML} and integrate the policies with applications through the use of a policy decision point ({PDP}). To assure that the specified polices reflect the expected ones, recent research has developed policy verification tools; however, their applications in practice are still limited, being constrained by the limited set of supported policy language features and the unavailability of policy properties. This paper presents a data-mining approach to the problem of verifying that expressed access-control policies reflect the true desires of the policy author. We developed a tool to investigate this approach by automatically generating requests, evaluating those requests to get responses, and applying machine learning on the request-response pairs to infer policy properties. These inferred properties facilitate the inspection of the policy behavior. We applied our tool on an access-control policy of a central grades repository system for a university. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can provide valuable insight into basic policy properties and help identify specific bug-exposing requests},

	title = {On the Feasibility of Attribute-Based Access Control Policy Mining},
	doi = {10.1109/IRI.2019.00047},
	abstract = {As the technology of attribute-based access control ({ABAC}) matures and begins to supplant earlier models such as role-based or discretionary access control, it becomes necessary to convert from already deployed access control systems to {ABAC}. Several variations of this general problem can be defined, some of which have been studied by researchers. In particular the {ABAC} policy mining problem assumes that attribute values for various entities such as users and objects in the system are given, in addition to the authorization state, from which the {ABAC} policy needs to be discovered. In this paper, we formalize the {ABAC} {RuleSet} Existence problem in this context and develop an algorithm and complexity analysis for its solution. We further introduce the notion of {ABAC} {RuleSet} Infeasibility Correction along with an algorithm for its solution.},

	abstract = {It is my belief that software engineers not only need to know software engineering methods and processes, but that they also should know how to assess them. Conse­ quently, I have taught principles of experimentation and empirical studies as part of the software engineering curriculum. Until now, this meant selecting a text from another discipline, usually psychology, and augmenting it with journal or confer­ ence papers that provide students with software engineering examples of experi­ ments and empirical studies. This book fills an important gap in the software engineering literature: it pro­ vides a concise, comprehensive look at an important aspect of software engineer­ ing: experimental analysis of how well software engineering methods, methodologies, and processes work. Since all of these change so rapidly in our field, it is important to know how to evaluate new ones. This book teaches how to go about doing this and thus is valuable not only for the software engineering stu­ dent, but also for the practicing software engineering professional who will be able to • Evaluate software engineering techniques. • Determine the value (or lack thereof) of claims made about a software engineer­ ing method or process in published studies. Finally, this book serves as a valuable resource for the software engineering researcher.},
