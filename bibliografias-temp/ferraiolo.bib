	abstract = {In this article we propose a standard for role-based access control ({RBAC}). Although {RBAC} models have received broad support as a generalized approach to access control, and are well recognized for their many advantages in performing large-scale authorization management, no single authoritative definition of {RBAC} exists today. This lack of a widely accepted model results in uncertainty and confusion about {RBAC}'s utility and meaning. The standard proposed here seeks to resolve this situation by unifying ideas from a base of frequently referenced {RBAC} models, commercial products, and research prototypes. It is intended to serve as a foundation for product development, evaluation, and procurement specification. Although {RBAC} continues to evolve as users, researchers, and vendors gain experience with its application, we feel the features and components proposed in this standard represent a fundamental and stable set of mechanisms that may be enhanced by developers in further meeting the needs of their customers. As such, this document does not attempt to standardize {RBAC} features beyond those that have achieved acceptance in the commercial marketplace and research community, but instead focuses on defining a fundamental and stable set of {RBAC} components. This standard is organized into the {RBAC} Reference Model and the {RBAC} System and Administrative Functional Specification. The reference model defines the scope of features that comprise the standard and provides a consistent vocabulary in support of the specification. The {RBAC} System and Administrative Functional Specification defines functional requirements for administrative operations and queries for the creation, maintenance, and review of {RBAC} sets and relations, as well as for specifying system level functionality in support of session attribute management and an access control decision process.},
