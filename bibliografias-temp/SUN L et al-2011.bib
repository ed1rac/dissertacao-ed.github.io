	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for privacy preserving access control policies and mechanisms, and describes algorithms for access policy conflicting problems. The mechanism enforces access policy to data containing personally identifiable information. The key component of the framework is purpose involved access control models ({PAC}) that provide full support for expressing highly complex privacy-related policies, taking into account features like purposes, conditions and obligations. Policy conflicting problems may arise when new access policies are generated that are possible to be conflicted to existing policies. As a result of the policy conflicts, private information cannot be well protected. The structure of access control policy including conditions and obligations is studied. Based on the access policy, authorization models and policy operations are analysed. Finally comparisons to related works {EPAL} are presented.},
