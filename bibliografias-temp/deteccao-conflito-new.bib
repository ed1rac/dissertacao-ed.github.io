	abstract = {Attribute-based access control ({ABAC}) policies are effective and flexible in governing the access to information and resources in open distributed computing environments. However, {ABAC} policy rules are often complex making them prone to conflicts. This paper proposes an optimized method to detect the conflicts between statistically conflicting rules in an {ABAC} policy. This method includes two optimization techniques: rule reduction and binary-search. The first technique reduces the rules into a set of compact, semantically equivalent rules through removing redundant information among the rules. The binary-search technique is then applied to discover the conflicts among them.},

	doi = {10.1109/CIS.2009.248},
	abstract = {Access control policy is a set of rules, which control and constraint the communication and access between all kinds of entities. Policy conflict is one of the outstanding issues related to policy management. Nevertheless current access control policy conflict detection algorithms are completely dependent on policy specification and the applications, which make these algorithms non-reusable and non-extensible. To resolve this problem, we separate the algorithm from concrete policy specification and apply a group of matrixes to define the relationship between all access control rules and all kinds of access control policy conflicts. Finally we develop an extensible intra-access control policy conflict detection algorithm that is independent of application domain to which the policies relate. The experimental result shows that the algorithm offers similar detection efficiency comparable to conventional detection algorithm.},

	abstract = {Privacy-aware Role-based Access Control (P-{RBAC}) model is one of Role-Based Access Control ({RBAC}) model extensions that has been proposed to help the enforcement of privacy policies. Despite the enhanced privacy protection mechanism by P-{RBAC}, its pair-wise policy conflict detection algorithm has been pointed out as one of its limitations because conflicts within more than two policies are not detected. In this paper, we review and extend P-{RBAC}'s existing conflict detection algorithm so that it can check conflicts in multiple policies. Our review includes the performance comparison on two conflict detection algorithms, triple-policy conflict detection vs. double-policy conflict detection. We find out that as the number of policies increases and the number of same condition variables in the policies increases, the running time complexity gets bigger. Especially for tripe-policy conflict, the probability of triple policy conflict also affects the complexity.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCMC48092.2020.ICCMC-000166},
	abstract = {Cloud computing offers several computing services like storage, networks, hardware, and software. The most beneficial cloud service is cloud storage. The organization or large industries can store their big data in cloud storage on pay for usage scheme. As the big data are outsourced in a distributed cloud environment, securing and protecting the big data is essential. The various access control models, which consist of a set of security policies, are used generally to protect the outsourced data. Anomalies in the security policies dilute the efficiency of the access security model. Developing an efficient access control model to protect the data is a challenging and ongoing process. The primary goal of this paper is to analyze and detect the important anomalies in Attribute-Based Access Control-{ABAC} Policies. This paper presents an approach that uses Priority-level to avoid the conflict in {ABAC} Policies. This approach groups the rules of {ABAC} policies based on Priority-level and similarity with the clustering technique, and detect the anomalies in each cluster rather than all rules, which made this approach efficient.},

	abstract = {Attribute-based access control ({ABAC}) is widely applied to complicate information system such as cloud computing and Internet of thing because of fine-grained authority and flexibility. However, conflicts between policy rules occur frequently due to its huge scale and complex expression. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting conflicts between {ABAC} rules with the help of converting rules to a set of binary sequences. Then the conflict detection is achieved throng the bitwise {AND} operation of binary sequence, which improves the efficiency of detection. Afterwards, the correctness of the method is illustrated by a concrete example. And the efficiency of the proposed method for complex and large-scale policy conflicts detection is verified by simulation experiments.},

To analyze and detect these conflicts, we first analyze the conflict types with respect to the relationship among the policy rules, and then formalize the conflicts by template matrices. We designed a model-checking algorithm to detect potential conflicts by establishing formalized matrices of the policy set. Lastly, we conducted experiments to verify the performance of the algorithm using various spatial data sets and rule sets. The results show that the algorithm can detect all the formalized conflicts. Moreover, the algorithm's efficiency is more influenced by the spatial object granularity than the size of the rule set.},
