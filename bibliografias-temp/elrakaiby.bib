	abstract = {Obligations are generally actions that users are required to take and are essential for the expression of a large number of requirements. For instance, obligation actions may represent prerequisites to gain some privilege (pre obligations), to satisfy some ongoing or post requirement for resource usage (ongoing and post obligations), or to adhere to some privacy or availability policy. Obligations may also define states of affairs which should be maintained. An example of such obligations is the obligation “doctors should remain alert while in the operating room”. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for the management and enforcement of obligation policies. The framework is formalized using concepts from action specification languages and the Event Condition Action paradigm of active databases. Therefore, our framework allows reasoning about change in the state of obligations and, at the same time, provides declarative formal semantics for their enforcement. In this framework, we support many types of obligations and show how to manage obligation activation, fulfillment and violation.},
