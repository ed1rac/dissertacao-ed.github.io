	shorttitle = {{MotOrBAC} 2},
	abstract = {Given the growing complexity of information systems and the difficult task of security policy enforcement, system administrators need simple and powerful security management tools. This article presents the second version of {MotOrBAC}, a tool that embeds policy specification and administration in a same model. {MotOrBAC} is able to simulate and analyze a security policy specified using the {OrBAC} model. It also implements the {AdOrBAC} model which is used to administrate {OrBAC}. This article presents why the {OrBAC} model has been chosen to implement such tool. We also present the {OrBAC} application programming interface used by the new version of {MotOrBAC} and how it can be integrated into other applications to enforce an {OrBAC} policy.},
