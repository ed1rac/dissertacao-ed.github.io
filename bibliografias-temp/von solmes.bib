	abstract = {Management normally sets company vision, rules and regulations through policies. These policies should provide guidance to employees and partners as to how they should act and behave to be in line with management's wishes. These policies need to be structured and organized effectively to cater for business and technological dynamics and advances. Having defined a series of company policies does not ensure that all employees will necessarily obey these policies. Ideally these policies must manifest in some company culture to ensure appropriate behaviour. This can only be achieved through a proper education process. This paper addresses exactly the process of integrating policies, education and culture.},
