	abstract = {Authorship proﬁling is the process of identifying authors’ demographic traits by analyzing their written text. It has several applications in areas such as security and forensic analysis. People use social media as a major platform to share their thoughts and ideas. However, they use more than one language for their writings. It is a challenging task to perform author proﬁling from multilingual short text. In this paper, we present our methodology for a task to identify gender and age of the author from their {SMS} messages using a machine learning approach. We have used a statistical feature selection methodology to select the features that are signiﬁcantly contributing for the gender and age classiﬁcations. We have performed paired t-test to show that the improvement in performance using feature selection is statistically signiﬁcant. We have evaluated our methodology using the data set given by {MAPonSMS}@{FIRE}20181 shared task, and have obtained 85\% and 63\% accuracy for gender and age classiﬁcations respectively.},
