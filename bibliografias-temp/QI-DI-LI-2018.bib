	abstract = {Integration of role-based access control model ({RBAC}) and attribute-based access control model ({ABAC}) has become a hot area of access control research recently. A lot of access control models based on role and attribute ({RABAC}) have been proposed so far. These models use {RBAC} to establish static relationships between users, roles and permissions, and then dynamically apply attribute-based access control rules to user-role mappings, role-permission mappings and user-permission mappings, which to some extent makes access control model easy to use and flexible. However, these models still have some shortcomings in terms of access control granularity, flexibility and decision efficiency. This paper studies the defects of the current {RABAC} models and the causes, proposes more fine-grained, flexible and efficient {RABAC} model, extends the evaluation indicators of access control model and analyzes the access control granularity, flexibility and decision efficiency of {RABAC} model theoretically.},
