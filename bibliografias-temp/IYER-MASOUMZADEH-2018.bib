	abstract = {Mining access control policies can reduce the burden of adopting more modern access control models by automating the process of generating policies based on existing authorization information in a system. Previous work in this area has focused on mining positive authorizations only. That includes the literature on mining rolebased access control policies (which are naturally about positive authorization) and even more recent work on mining attributebased access control ({ABAC}) policies. However, various theoretical access control models (including {ABAC}), specification standards (such as {XACML}), and implementations (such as operating systems and databases) support negative authorization as well as positive authorization.},
